            <h2>Game Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Game is played with four players. Each round, cards (chits) are shuffled and randomly assigned as Raja, Mantri, Chor, and Sipahi.</li>
                <li>Each player picks a card secretly to get their role for the round.</li>
                <li>The player who gets the Mantri card must guess who is the Chor (from the two hidden cards: Chor and Sipahi).</li>
                <li>If Mantri guesses correctly:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Raja gets 1000 points</li>
                        <li>Mantri gets 500 points</li>
                        <li>Sipahi gets 500 points</li>
                        <li>Chor gets 0 points</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If Mantri guesses incorrectly:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Chor and Mantri swap their cards</li>
                        <li>Points are given according to the swapped cards:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Raja gets 1000 points</li>
                                <li>New Mantri gets 500 points</li>
                                <li>Sipahi gets 500 points</li>
                                <li>New Chor gets 1000 points</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>After each round, points are added to each player's total.</li>
                <li>After all rounds, the player with the highest points becomes Raja, second highest Mantri, third Sipahi, and lowest Chor.</li>
            </ul>
